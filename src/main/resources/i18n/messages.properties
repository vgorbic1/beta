#about.html
about.jumbotron.h1=About Page
about.jumbotron.p=This is something about our company
about.content.column1.h3=Services
about.content.column1.p1=The depth and breadth of our firm's expertise is unmatched. We continue \
	to add new experts, analytics capabilities and ways for our clients to access the insights \
	they need every day.
about.content.column1.p2=Organizational health does not just mean ensuring that people are \
	happy. Nor is it about corporate culture for culture's sake. The underlying concept is \
	that performance and organizational health are inextricably linked. There is no \
	long-term performance without real organizational health.
about.content.column2.h3=Our Team
about.content.column2.p1=We define organizational health as the ability to sustain performance \
	over the long term by having employees who continually demonstrate three key competencies: one, \
	they understand where the organization is going and how it plans to get there; two, they have the \
	tools, capabilities, and motivation to put those plans into action; and three, they are \
	encouraged to innovate and adapt to change in order to keep the organization ahead of the game.
about.content.column2.p2=We think there's a lot to be gained by integrating our strength in \
	organizational strategy and health with Gallup's deep insight into the attitudes and behaviors of \
	individual employees. Combining this data and knowledge is going to mean we can look at \
	organizational health in ways that havenâ€™t been possible before.
